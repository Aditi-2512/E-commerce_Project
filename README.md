##  CSV to PostgreSQL Data Pipeline
In this project, we developed a comprehensive data pipeline that ingests data from CSV files into a Python environment and deploys the data into an SQL database for further analysis of our data.
Data models are designed to accurately represent the relationships and structure of the dataset, ensuring data integrity and consistency during transfer
## Technologies
- Python - Jupyter Notebook
- SQL - PostgreSQL

1. The project begins by importing the necessary libraries in Python, especially pandas, which is great for handling CSV files.
2. Then initiate a connection to PostgreSQL and create the database with auto-commit being run.
3. Tables are created with the appropriate columns and data types.
4. Data is fed into the newly created tables and then analysis is done on that data
